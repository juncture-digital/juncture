# Annotating Images

This tutorial will walk through the steps to add, delete, and view annotations in images.

To add an annotation to an image, click the 'Toggle Preview' button in the bottom right of the editor to view your essay and image. In preview mode, click the Annontation icon in the bottom left corner of the image. Once activated, you can add an annotation by holding the SHIFT key and clicking and dragging your mouse to create the bounding box for your annotation. Once the region is selected, add the annotation text in the box that appears.

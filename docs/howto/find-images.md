# Finding Images

This page is aimed towards providing useful resources for finding Open Source images and pre-existing IIIF Manifests.

### IIIF Manifests

The [IIIF website](https://iiif.io/) provides a brief guide to finding IIIF Manifests from a list of collections, which you can find [here](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/).

### Open Source Collections
[WikiMedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is an online repository of free-use image, sound, and other media files that is part of the Wikimedia ecosystem.

[JSTOR](https://jstor.org) is a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources. You can search for open access images on JSTOR using [this query](https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=cc_reuse_license%3A%22public+domain%22+OR+cc_reuse_license%3A%22Creative+Commons%22+-cc_reuse_license%3A%28NonCommercial+OR+NoDerivs%29&efqs=eyJjdHkiOlsiWTI5dWRISnBZblYwWldSZmFXMWhaMlZ6Il0sImRpc2MiOltdfQ%3D%3D&searchkey=1677864936160&pagemark=eyJwYWdlIjoyLCJzdGFydHMiOnsiSlNUT1JCYXNpYyI6MjV9fQ%253D%253D) and search for your topic or subject using the Search Bar in the navigation menu on the left side of the page.

### Personal Images and Github Repositories

You can use any image from your personal GitHub repository in a Juncture essay and a IIIF manifest will be generated by Juncture for your GitHub hosted image. A helpful tool in managing your images is the [Juncture Media Tool](https://www.juncture-digital.org/#/embedded-media). [Here](https://www.juncture-digital.org/howto/setup-media-collection) is a guide to using the media tool to set up a personal media collection.

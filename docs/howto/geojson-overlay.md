# How To Use a GeoJSON Map Overlay

This tutorial will walk through how to create a GeoJSON file to include in your Juncture essay. For more background information on what GeoJSON is, visit this page in the documentation.

## Creating a GeoJSON File
geojson.io is a free, open source tool for creating and viewing GeoJSON files. Using this page, create the desired overlay for your map. You can also edit the JSON directly in the panel on the right, as well as customize properties for your visualization, such as color and fill size, using the pop up interface in geojson.io.

Once you have added and edited your data, download the JSON file by navigating to the `Save` tab in the top right and clicking `GeoJSON`.

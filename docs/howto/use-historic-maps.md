# Historic Map Overlays

This guide will walk through using the [AllMaps](https://allmaps.org/) editor on a historic map to overlay your map in a Juncture essay.

## Creating an AllMaps ID
In order for your image to be placed in the right location on a map, there must be georeference points that indicate where the image should be overlayed. This can be done using the [AllMaps Editor](https://editor.allmaps.org/#/). To use this, you need a IIIF Manifest URL. Enter it into the input box and once it is loaded in AllMaps, navigate to the 'Georeference' tab.
